# eth-xipfs

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io)-augmented [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) function calls enabling lower gas consumption & data encryption.

Also known as **xIPFS** in short for eXtended IPFS function call.

## Abstract

Ethereum is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, feature smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that can execute peer-to-peer smart contracts while transacting in Ethereum's native cryptocurrency â€“ Ether (ETH).

## Motivations

The very nature of peer-to-peer smart contract means that it is public and open, with full visibility on not only its execution instructions, but also function calls, arguments and parameters. There may, however, be use cases, where privacy of data may be of concern, for example, not wanting to leak your phone number when sending notification from Ethereum SMS service.

Sending of encrypted data, including but not limited to cipher and ciphertext, on Ethereum blockchain can get expensive in gas costs for on-chain storage, an alternative off-chain storage would help alleviate the usage cost. IPFS is a great candidate for the following reasons:

1. Its content-based addressing scheme guarantees data integrity without the need to separately store hash on Ethereum blockchain.
1. Like Ethereum, IPFS is decentralized. Encryption and data hosting can be done independent of service providers.
1. It is free, with the requirement of having an IPFS node.

## Specification

### Encryption scheme

xIPFS utilizes a similar encryption design as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) involving both symmetric-key cryptography and public-key (RSA) cryptography.

#### Encryption flow

1. Prepare payload of function arguments in JSON array without the function name or argument names, for instance:

    ```json
      ["param1", 2344', "param3"]
    ```

1. Select a supported symmetric-key cipher of choice, say aes-256-cbc. Randomly, or psuedo-randomly generate the key, and initialization vector (IV) (if required by cipher of choice).

1. Encrypt the payload from step 1 with the selected symmetric-key cipher using the key and IV derived from step 2.

1. Encrypt the generated key, and IV, **individually**, with the published RSA public key of smart contract.

1. With the results from steps 3 and 4, store the following JSON object on IPFS and notes its IPFS hash.

    ```json
    {
      "data": "symmetrically encrypted data from step 3",
      "key": "public-key encrypted key from step 4",
      "iv": "public-key encrypted iv from step 4",
      "cipher": "cipher of choice, e.g.: aes-256-cbc"
    }
    ```
